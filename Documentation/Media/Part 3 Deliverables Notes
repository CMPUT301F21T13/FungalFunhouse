Database Implementation is not modular.
-we have trouble with the database taking to long to return queries, this would lead to values not being returned properly in methods (often resulting in NullExceptionPointers)
-after research ways to implement a modular db we could make any type of implemention work. 
-posts online noted that the best way to avoid the issues we were having was to not make the db implementation modular.
-after consulting with our TA we decided to remove modularity (at least for the time being)



Other Notes:
-javadoc are incomplete
-UML diagram is incomplete
(due to use having only 4 members in our group we ran into time management issues to fill the requirements for part 3)
